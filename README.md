# Search Engine Project Summary!
This project is a C++ command-line tool for encrypting and decrypting text using both Caesar and Substitution ciphers. It includes an implementation of a hill-climbing algorithm designed to efficiently solve substitution ciphers. The algorithm works by generating random keys, that contain the new alphamet that each letter is mapped to, then iteratively improving them by swapping letters and calculating the likelihood that the resulting text resembles English, using quadgram frequency analysis. The program can handle multiple rounds of optimization and consistently producing accurate decryption results. Non-alphabetic characters such as punctuation and spaces are preserved during encryption and decryption to ensure the structure of the original text is maintained. This tool is capable of processing complex ciphertexts while ensuring that the output is both readable and faithful to the original formatting.
